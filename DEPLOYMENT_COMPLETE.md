## 📊 Current Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Birth Certificate Fields Empty

**Problem:** Birth certificate records are being created but fields (Child Name, DOB, Father, Mother) are empty.

**Debugging Steps:**
1. Check Railway logs for detailed error messages
2. Look for validation errors in console
3. Verify form data is being sent correctly from frontend

**To Check Railway Logs:**
1. Go to Railway dashboard
2. Click on `noble-reflection` service
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Click "View logs" on latest deployment
5. Look for "=== Birth Certificate Creation Request ===" messages

**Possible Causes:**
- Frontend form not sending data correctly
- Field names mismatch between frontend and backend
- Validation failing silently
- Database constraints

## 🔍 How to Debug Birth Certificate Issue

### Step 1: Test with API Directly

Use the test endpoint to verify database is working:

```bash
curl -X POST https://your-railway-url/api/birth-certificates/test
```

This should create a test certificate with all fields populated.

### Step 2: Check Frontend Form

Verify the form is sending data:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Network tab
3. Submit a birth certificate
4. Check the request payload

### Step 3: Check Railway Logs

Look for the detailed logs we added:
- "Received data:" - Shows what backend received
- "Validated data:" - Shows data after validation
- "Created certificate:" - Shows what was saved to database
